# Orienteering-Problem
In this game, individual competitors start at a specified control point, try to visit as many checkpoints as possible and return to the control point within a given time frame. Each checkpoint has a certain score and the objective is to maximise the total collected score. The OP is a combination of vertex selection and determining the shortest Hamiltonian path between the selected vertices. As a consequence, the OP can be seen as a combination between the Knapsack Problem (KP) and the Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP). The OPâ€™s goal is to maximise the total score collected, while the TSP tries to minimise the travel time or distance. Furthermore, not all vertices have to be visited in the OP. Determining the shortest path between the selected vertices will be helpful to visit as many vertices as possible in the available time. (Vansteenwegen et al., 2011)
